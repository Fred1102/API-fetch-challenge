# API-fetch-challenge

## Installation
First, we downloaded an API with beers into the IDE and created a mutual repository. Then we added three pages: html, css and javascript. 

## Usage
The use of this site will be to have a insightful catalogue of beers, so the customer has a good overview of the beers he or she would like to order in our bar. 

## Contributing
Madalina did great contributions with javascript, but she somehow mixed a lot of styling to the javascript. This made contribution a little bit difficult, since I was responsible for the CSS. In the end, we found the mistake and everything worked as planned. 

## API Reference
API of a 375 beers that we have fetched into the website.
